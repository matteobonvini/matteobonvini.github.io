I am a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My thesis advisor is [Professor Edward Kennedy](http://www.ehkennedy.com/). I am interested in studying causal inference, machine learning and nonparametric statistics, with applications in health and social sciences.

Before starting grad school at CMU, I worked at [Cornerstone Research](https://www.cornerstone.com/) as analyst. In 2016, I graduated from [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) with a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics; my thesis advisor was [Dr. Victoria Liublinska](https://sites.google.com/site/vliublinska/).
